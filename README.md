# Real-Time-Body-Gesture-Recogniser-and-its-Application-in-Human-Computer-Interaction
Successfully trained a machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier (RFC) that can identify 5 gestures (made from a combination of hands and facial expressions) in real-time. Demonstrated real-world application of gesture recognition by enabling users to control their local deviceâ€™s mouse and audio using hand gestures.

# Real-Time Simulation Results
